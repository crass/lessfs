                                : This release changes lessfs internals in a major way.
                                : Lessfs-1.1.0 is _not_ compatible with previous lessfs versions.
                                : This new version provides a much improved cache layer and
                                : way better performance. Threading has been improved and lessfs

                                : without transactions enabled. The segfault occurs when
