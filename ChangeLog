                                : continue for ever. I am not sure if this is a kernel
                                : issue or a lessfs bug. With earlier kernels direct_io

        release                 : 0.2.2   2009-06-21
                                : This release adds supports for NFS. It also fixes
                                : some potential problems with the internal cache code.
                                : NFS is only supported with kernel >= 2.6.30 earlier
                                : kernels will corrupt large files written with NFS!
                                : A lot of code has changed in this release so please
                                : do not use this version for production.

        release                 : 0.2.1   2009-06-10
        Resolved problems       : Improved the performance of writes smaller then
				  max_write in size. These writes will now remain long
                                  enough in the cache so that subsequent writes to the
                                  same block will update the cache instead of the database.
                                  Mounting lessfs without formatting the filesystem now
                                  logs a warning instead of creating a segfault.
                                  Creating of sparse files now works again after being
                                  broken in release 0.1.19.

        release                 : 0.2.0   2009-05-25
        Improved performance    : Added a cache that increases throughput with almost 30%.

        release                 : 0.1.22  2009-05-14
        Resolved problems       : One last problem with hardlinking symlinks.
                                  Lessfs will now stop all I/O before the disks run out of space
                                  and corrupt the databases.
        Known problems          : Multithreaded I/O in the same file sometimes fails
                                  under exceptional circumstances. (bonnie++).

        Known problems          : Multithreaded I/O in the same file sometimes fails
