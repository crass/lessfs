Lessfs now supports two different hashes.
1. The tiger hash.
2. Midnight blue wish.

It is now also possible to select the lenght of the hash. A shorter
hash will increase the speed as well as the risk of a hash collision.

You can select a size between 20 and 32 bytes.
The size of the full tiger hash (24 bytes, 192 bits) is selected by default.
