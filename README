lessfs requires tokyocabinet to be installed on the system.
http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/index.html

On 32bit systems don't forget to configure tokyocabinet with:
./configure --enable-off64 
Failure to do so will limit the databases to a 2GB filesize.

If you choose to upgrade from older lessfs release (< lessfs-1.0.4) 
to lessfs with transaction support then do only use lessfs-1.0.8 or 
higher with you use the file_io backend.


This project was imported from the upstream, but I think the repo is not
being used for main development any more.
git cvsimport -d:pserver:anonymous@lessfs.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lessfs \
    -r upstream-cvs -v lessfs2
