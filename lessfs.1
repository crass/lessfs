.SH NAME
lessfs - An inline data deduplicating filesystem
.SH SYNTAX
.nf
\fBlessfs\fR /etc/lessfs.cfg /mountpoint\\
[\fB-o\fR big_writes,max_read=nnnn,max_write=nnnn]
.fi
.SH VERSION
This man page documents lessfs version 1.0.8
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlessfs\fR is a filesystem that performs inline data deduplication. lessfs uses the 192-bit (24-byte) tiger hash algorithm to compare the data. The filesystem compresses the unique data blocks with LZO or QUICKLZ compression before writing them to disk.
.PP
.SS OPTIONS
.IP "big_writes"
Greatly improves throughput when the filesystem is used for backup purposes. It requires a recent kernel >=2.6.26 and a recent version of libfuse.
Must be used with max_read and max_write.
.IP "max_read"
Specify the blocksize, lessfs requires max_read and max_write to be equal. 
Valid values are : 4096,8192,16384,32768,65536,131072
.IP "max_write"
See max_read
.IP "Please read the fuse documentation for other fuse related options."
.IP "Examples of usage:"
.nf
Mounting lessfs with BLKSIZE specified in the configuration file is very simple.
lessfs /etc/lessfs.cfg /fuse

This will result in lessfs being mounted with the arguments:
-ohard_remove,negative_timeout,entry_timeout=0,\\
  attr_timeout=0,use_ino,readdir_ino,default_permissions,allow_other,\\
  big_writes,max_read=BLKSIZE,max_write=BLKSIZE

You can override the default settings removing the BLKSIZE line from the
configuration file and specifying the options on the commandline.
To mount lessfs with a \fB4k\fR blocksize.
lessfs /etc/lessfs.cfg /fuse  -o negative_timeout=0,\\
       entry_timeout=0,attr_timeout=0,use_ino,\\
       readdir_ino,default_permissions,allow_other,\\
       max_read=4096,max_write=4096

To mount lessfs with a \fB128k\fR blocksize.
lessfs /etc/lessfs.cfg /fuse -o negative_timeout=0,\\
       entry_timeout=0,attr_timeout=0,use_ino,\\
       readdir_ino, default_permissions,allow_other,\fBbig_writes\fR,\\
       max_read=131072,max_write=131072
\fB*\fR A recent kernel >=2.6.26 and a recent version of libfuse are required.
\fBWARNING :\fR DO NOT USE max_read/max_write > 4096 with kernels older then 2.6.26.
.fi
.SS LESSFS CONFIGURATION FILE.
lessfs requires a configuration file that contains information about the
tokyocabinet databases that actually hold the filesystem data. You may choose
not to include some of the variables in the configuration file. In this case you
should export the variables into the environment. 
Example: export BLOCKDATA_PATH=/data/dta
This feature can be used for scripting.
The configuration file should otherwise contain the following variables:
.IP BLOCKDATA_IO_TYPE
.nf
The way that lessfs stores the actual data. 
Valid options are \fBfile_io\fR or \fBtokyocabinet\fR
Example: BLOCKDATA_IO_TYPE=file_io
tokyocabinet is selected by default.
.fi
.IP "BLOCKDATA_PATH"
.nf
The path to a directory that holds the blockdata database or file.
Example with tokyocabinet : BLOCKDATA_PATH=/data/dta
Example with file_io : BLOCKDATA_PATH=/data/dta/mydtafile
.fi
.IP "BLOCKDATA_BS"
.nf
The bucketsize of the blockdata database. 
See the tokyocabinet documentation for details.
http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/spex-en.html
Example: BLOCKDATA_BS=10485760
.fi
.IP "BLOCKUSAGE_PATH"
The path to the directory that holds the database that contains blockusage information.
.nf
Example: BLOCKUSAGE_PATH=/data/mta
.fi
.IP "BLOCKUSAGE_BS"
The bucketsize of the blockusage database. See BLOCKDATA_BS.
.IP "DIRENT_PATH"
The path to the directory that holds the directory structures.
.nf
.IP "DIRENT_BS"
The bucketsize of the dirent database. See BLOCKDATA_BS.
Example: DIRENT_BS=1048576
.fi
.IP "FILEBLOCK_PATH"
The path to the directory that holds the database that contains the tigerhash of the inode-blocknr combination. The data that belongs to the hash can be found in the BLOCKDATA database.
.IP "FILEBLOCK_BS"
The bucketsize of the fileblock database. See BLOCKDATA_BS.
Example: FILEBLOCK_BS=10485760
.IP "META_PATH"
The path to the database that contains the metadata (struct stat) of the files.
.IP "META_BS"
See BLOCKDATA_BS.
.IP "HARDLINK_PATH"
The path to the database that contains data about hardlinks.
.IP "HARDLINK_BS"
See BLOCKDATA_BS.
.IP "SYMLINK_PATH"
The path to the database that contains data about symlinks.
.IP "SYMLINK_BS"
See BLOCKDATA_BS.
.IP "FREELIST_PATH"
Only needed with the file_io backend, ignored otherwise. Is used to keep track of free (deleted) chunks of data.
.IP "FREELIST_BS"
Only needed with the file_io backend.
See BLOCKDATA_BS.
.IP LISTEN_IP=127.0.0.1
Specify the ip address where the lessfs management port binds to. Lessfs supports freeze and database defragmentation commands through this interface. 
.IP LISTEN_PORT=100
Specifies the port where the management interface binds on. Default is port 100.
.IP MIN_SPACE_FREE=10
Specifies the minimum percentage or free space that has to be available. Lessfs suspends all I/O when less then the minumum required space is reached. This value defaults to 10%.
.IP MIN_SPACE_CLEAN=25
When MIN_SPACE_CLEAN is configured the program specified by CLEAN_PROGRAM will be executed. This program/script can be used to warn the administator or automatically delete old files. Please note that when CLEAN_PROGRAM is used with the file_io backend deleting files from lessfs will not free disk space on the underlying filesystem since file_io only marks deleted blocks as free in the freelist database.
.IP CLEAN_PROGRAM=/usr/local/bin/warn_me.sh 
.IP HASHLEN = 24
The lenght of the hash that identifies the blocks of data measured in bytes. Minimum 20, maximum 32.
.br
The default value is 24 (192 bits).
.IP CACHESIZE=512
The cachesize megabytes that lessfs is allowed to use as write cache.
.IP COMMIT_INTERVAL=30
.IP MAX_THREADS=2
Do not set MAX_THREADS higher then the number of CPU cores available in the system. Lessfs will use MAX_THREADS	CPU cores for LZO or QUICKLZ compression to compress MAX_THREADS data blocks in parallel. The performance will suffer when this number is set higher then the number of CPU cores that are available in the system.
.IP COMMIT_INTERVAL=30
Maximum age of entries that are kept in the cache. After this the cache will be written to disk.
.IP DYNAMIC_DEFRAGMENTATION=on
Enable tokyocabinets automatic defragmentation feature. Default = off when not specified.
.IP COREDUMPSIZE=25600000
Enable generation of coredumps for debugging. Default = off. Only usefull when lessfs is compiled with CFLAGS=-ggdb2
.IP SYNC_RELAX=0 
Valid options are : 0 (default) , 1 or 2
.br
\fB0\fR Flush all caches in lessfs for an inode and sync the tokyocabinet databases to disk when fsync is called for an inode.
.br 
\fB1\fR Do not sync the tokyocabinet databases to the disk when fsync is called on an inode. The inode data will be written directly to the databases. In case of a crash the databases themselves might not be committed to disk. This feature improves some types of I/O and is especially useful with NFS. There is a trade-off between more speed and the chance of possible loss of data. \fBUse with caution.\fR
.br
\fB2\fR Living on the edge. Do not flush the caches in lessfs and do not sync the tokyocabinet databases to disk. \fBUse with extreme caution.\fR
.IP ENCRYPT_DATA=off
.br
Enable data encryption. Requires lessfs to be configured with --with-crypto
.br
Valid options are : off (default) or on
.IP ENCRYPT_META=off
.br
Enable meta data encryption. Requires lessfs to be configured with --with-crypto and is only valid with ENCRYPT_DATA=on
.br
It is sometime usefull to disable meta data encryption. For example when one stores email messages in qmail/maildir format the name of the messages is not sensitive. To gain performance you might choose to encrypt only the data of the messages. \fBUse with caution.\fR
.br
Valid options are : on (default) or off
.IP ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS=on
Enable or disable transactions. Without transactions enabled lessfs will need to be repaired with fsck after a crash. The downside of enabling transactions is a mild performance impact.
.br
Valid options are : off (default) or on
.IP BLKSIZE=131072
When BLKSIZE is specified in the configuration file lessfs can be mounted without specifying options. In this case lessfs will use a number of default options that make sense in most cases. If you would like to specify the options yourself then remove this line from the configuration.
.br
Valid options are: 4096,8192,16384,32768,65536,131072 
.IP PASSWORD=somepassword
When lessfs is used with encryption support enabled it is allowed though not recommended to specify the password in the configuration file. It is also possible to export the password in the environment with export PASSWORD=somepassword. Normally lessfs will prompt for a password when the filesystem is mounted. This is the default.
.IP DEBUG=2
Valid options are 0..5.
.br
\fB0\fR  Disable logging with the exception of critical errors.
.br
\fB1\fR  Enable logging of critical errors and warnings.
.br
\fB2\fR  Enable logging of critical errors, warnings and informational messages.
.br
\fB3\fR  Enable logging of critical errors, warnings, informational messages and debug messages.
.br
\fB>3\fR Enable logging of critical errors, warnings, informational messages and debug and other messages.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
To debug the filesystem configure lessfs with : ./configure --enable-debug
.br
Change the value of DEBUG to 5 in lessfs.cfg before you run lessfs.
